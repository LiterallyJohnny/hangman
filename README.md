# Hangman
**TODO:**
- However many letters are in the word, transform them to underscores
- Let the player guess the letters
- If the letter the player guesses is in the word, replace the underscores with the word
- Every time the player guesses a word that doesn't have any of the letters they chose, remove a change

## Info
This is a hangman program written in Python. You get a set number of chances, and you must guess the word without losing all of your changes.
